# Minimized Tabs Outliner (wrapped .ps1).bat
IMPORTANT: the following title must be made identical to the one that you see in the tiny preview window when your cursor is on the chrome icon in the taskbar (with the 'new tab' chrome window in view): `"Nieuw tabblad - Google Chrome"` (Dutch language).

The powershell wrapper/batch-powershell hybrid makes using the powershell script as easy as with any other executable file. Easily run the embedded powershell script by double clicking the .bat file. It also makes it super easy when you create a shortcut of it, which I recommended you do to make it run minimized as well. Simply right-click the .bat file and then click on "Create shortcut". These actions won't work with non-wrapped .ps1 files and would have required a more difficult workflow, which isn't particularly straightforward for the end user. For example to create a shortcut of a standard .ps1 file, you would have to open the shortcut wizard and include some text in front of the file location to explicitly run it with powershell, and even more text for bypassing the execution policy, to make it work on all devices.
