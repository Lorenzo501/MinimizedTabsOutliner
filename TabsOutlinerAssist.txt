I noticed that if you click the green X to close and save something in tabs outliner
and if you then close Tabs Outliner too fast afterwards, then it won't have enough time to save the closed tab(s)
in which case they'll disappear from tabs outliner entirely as if they were closed normally..
I can improve this by having a lightweight AHK script to stay active while the Tabs Outliner window exists
so I could even start TabsOutlinerAssist.ahk with MinimizedTabsOutliner.ahk^^ using cmd line arg --assist
