# Chrome Watcher (automatic).ahk
IMPORTANT: this AHK script expects Tabs Outliner to appear and uses this as the cue to stop the script. So make sure that Tabs Outliner gets started automatically at chrome startup and close all chrome windows (including Tabs Outliner) before you use this script. When you start this script, chrome will start automatically and you'll get a logger.txt on your desktop with all the chrome event data (including Tabs Outliner ofc).

# Chrome Watcher (with hotkeys).ahk
When you start this AHK script, you can press `F1` to start chrome and you'll get a logger.txt on your desktop with all the chrome event data. But you will have to press it again to stop the data logging yourself. You can also press `F2` to close all the chrome windows by force. And you can press `F3` to stop the script.
